# pictools-scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts that I use to manage pictures and editing files with the command line.

## Installation

```bash
git clone
cd pictools-scripts
./install.sh
```

All scripts will be installed in the `/usr/local/bin` directory and the configuration file will be copied to
`/usr/local/etc` directory.
